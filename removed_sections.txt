            <p>
              Beyond providing empirical validation of our initial hypothesis that audio anti-spoof detectors are sensitive to small linguistic changes in the audio's underlying transcripts, we conducted a detailed feature analysis. This section aims to investigate and analyze what factors and how much they associate with varying anti-spoofing detectors' decisions under adversarial attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              We extracted three main categories of features from our <strong>108 open-source attack experiments</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Linguistic Features (LF):</strong> These capture characteristics at the transcript level that shift under adversarial attacks. Key features include:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Perturbed Percentage:</strong> The fraction of modified words.</li>
                  <li><strong>Readability Difference:</strong> Change in reading comprehension difficulty.</li>
                  <li><strong>Semantic Similarity:</strong> How much the meaning is preserved.</li>
                  <li><strong>Perplexity Difference:</strong> Change in language model perplexity.</li>
                  <li><strong>Syntactic Complexity Difference:</strong> Change in syntactic tree depth.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Acoustic Features (AF):</strong> These measure differences in the generated audio due to transcript changes:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>DTW Distance:</strong> Alignment cost between mel spectrograms.</li>
                  <li><strong>Duration Difference:</strong> Change in audio length.</li>
                  <li><strong>Phoneme Perplexity Difference:</strong> Change in phoneme sequence unpredictability.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aesthetics Difference:</strong> Shifts in automated audio quality assessments (Content Enjoyment, Content Usefulness, Production Complexity, Production Quality).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Model-Level Features (MF):</strong> These relate to how the detector itself processes the audio:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Audio Encoder Similarity (AES):</strong> How closely audios from the same voice cluster in the detector's internal representation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Spoof and Bona-fide F1:</strong> The detector's pre-existing performance metrics, reflecting potential biases.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

              <strong>Table 4</strong>: Logistic regression feature analysis for bona-fide detection on adversarial samples. ▲ is the difference and Semantic Similarity feature is removed due to the high Variance Inflation Factor to avoid multicollinearity.
            </p>


            <p>
              We then performed a logistic regression analysis using these features to predict
              the bona-fide probability assigned to the adversarial audio samples. The
              results showed that several linguistic and model-level features had
              statistically significant associations with the detector's output.
            </p>

            <p>
              Notably, a higher
              <strong>Perturbed Percentage</strong> is associated with a lower likelihood of
              being classified as bona-fide. Surprisingly, increased
              <strong>Readability Difference</strong> and <strong>Perplexity Difference</strong>
              correlate positively with bona-fide probability, suggesting that making
              transcripts linguistically more complex can sometimes fool detectors.
            </p>

            <p>
              Among Acoustic Features, larger <strong>DTW Distance</strong> and
              <strong>Duration Difference</strong> (more spectral and temporal deviation) also
              correlated with higher bona-fide probabilities. This indicates that transcript
              changes can indeed lead to acoustic changes that influence detection. Features
              related to enhanced audio aesthetics (Content Enjoyment and Usefulness) also
              suggested an increased likelihood of deceiving detectors.
            </p>

            <p>
              The strongest predictor of vulnerability was
              <strong>Audio Encoder Similarity (AES)</strong>. A high AES score (meaning
              the detector sees the synthesized audio for a voice as very similar internally)
              is strongly associated with a *lower* chance of the adversarial attack
              succeeding. This suggests that detectors with audio encoders that tightly
              cluster synthesized audio are more robust. Finally, the detector's initial
              <strong>Spoof and Bona-fide F1 scores</strong> were also significant predictors,
              indicating that pre-existing biases influence how well attacks work.
            </p>

            <p>
              These findings highlight that both the linguistic properties of the transcript
              and the detector's internal audio representations play crucial roles in their
              vulnerability to these attacks, pointing towards the need for defenses that
              consider both aspects.

                Commercial anti-spoofing detector API-A also shows vulnerability to
                transcript-level adversarial attacks. We observe a substantial drop in
                <strong>Original Accuracy (OC)</strong> and
                <strong>Accuracy Under Attack (AUA)</strong> for API-A, particularly with
                high-fidelity OpenAI TTS, resulting in a high
                <strong>Attack Success Rate (ASR)</strong> of 66.3%. While API-B
                appears more robust initially, its high
                <strong>Original Accuracy (OC)</strong> is partly due to a bias. The
                open-source CLAD model, when evaluated with OpenAI TTS, demonstrates an
                extremely high <strong>Attack Success Rate (ASR)</strong> of 95.3%. The
                high <strong>Semantic Preservation Score (COS)</strong> indicates the
                attacks maintain the original meaning, highlighting a concerning
                vulnerability in state-of-the-art commercial systems.
